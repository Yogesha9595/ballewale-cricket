In a gripping encounter at the World Cup, England narrowly defeated Nepal in a last-ball thriller that kept fans on the edge of their seats. The match, held at the iconic stadium in Ahmedabad, showcased the unpredictability of cricket, with Nepal pushing the reigning champions to their limits. England, who entered the tournament as one of the favorites, faced a determined Nepalese side that displayed remarkable skill and tenacity throughout the match.

Batting first, England posted a competitive total of 265 runs, thanks to a solid performance from their top order. Joe Root and Ben Stokes anchored the innings with a partnership that added much-needed stability after early wickets fell. Root's elegant 85 and Stokes' aggressive 70 were pivotal in setting a challenging target. However, the England bowlers faced an unexpected challenge as Nepal's batting lineup, led by their captain, played with flair and aggression. Despite losing wickets at regular intervals, Nepal's middle order fought back, with a spirited 90-run partnership that brought them within striking distance of an incredible upset.

As the match reached its climax, the tension in the stadium was palpable. Nepal required 15 runs off the final over, and the crowd erupted as the underdogs began to believe in a historic victory. However, England's experienced bowler held his nerve, executing crucial deliveries under pressure. With just one run needed off the last ball, Nepal's batsman swung for glory but could only manage a single, leaving the match tied. England emerged victorious by virtue of their superior net run rate, but the match will be remembered for the heart and determination shown by the Nepalese team.
