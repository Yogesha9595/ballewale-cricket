In a historic achievement for Jammu & Kashmir, Mohammad Nabi's remarkable bowling display, which included a stunning 12 wickets across both innings, propelled the team to their first-ever semi-final in the Ranji Trophy. The quarter-final match against Madhya Pradesh concluded on a dramatic note, with J&K securing a 112-run victory at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur, marking a significant milestone in the state's cricketing journey.

Nabi's performance was nothing short of extraordinary, as he claimed 6 wickets for 45 runs in the first innings and followed it up with 6 for 68 in the second. His ability to consistently trouble the opposition batsmen with his spin bowling proved crucial in dismantling Madhya Pradesh's batting order. J&K's bowlers complemented Nabi's efforts well, with the team managing to restrict MP to 140 and 188 runs in their two innings, respectively.

Chasing a target of 300 runs, Madhya Pradesh struggled to build partnerships, with only a few batsmen managing to make notable contributions. The J&K bowlers maintained relentless pressure, and despite a valiant effort from their middle order, the team ultimately fell short. This victory not only secures J&K's place in the semi-finals but also highlights the growing strength and potential of cricket in the region.

With this win, Jammu & Kashmir will now prepare to face a formidable opponent in the semi-finals, as they aim to continue their fairytale run in the tournament. The team’s achievement is a testament to their hard work and determination, and it has undoubtedly ignited a sense of pride among their supporters. As the Ranji Trophy progresses, all eyes will be on J&K to see if they can continue their impressive form and make further history in Indian domestic cricket.
