The match, held at the iconic Eden Gardens in Kolkata, witnessed a remarkable display of skill and determination from Nabi, who claimed 6 wickets in the first innings and followed it up with another 6 in the second. His exceptional bowling not only dismantled the Madhya Pradesh batting lineup but also showcased his prowess as one of the leading bowlers in the domestic circuit.
