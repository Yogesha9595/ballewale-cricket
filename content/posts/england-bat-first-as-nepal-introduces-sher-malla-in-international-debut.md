In a highly anticipated international fixture, England won the toss and elected to bat first against Nepal, marking a significant occasion for the visiting team as they handed a debut cap to Sher Malla. The match, held at the Tribhuvan University International Cricket Ground in Kathmandu, is part of a bilateral series aimed at enhancing competitive cricket between the two nations.

England's decision to bat first reflects their strategy of setting a challenging target for the home side, with a strong batting lineup that includes seasoned players. The pitch conditions are expected to favor the batsmen early on, providing an opportunity for England to capitalize on the fresh surface. With the World Cup approaching, every match is crucial for England as they look to fine-tune their squad and strategies ahead of the tournament.

On the other hand, Sher Malla's inclusion in the Nepalese side is a significant milestone for the young cricketer and the nation.
