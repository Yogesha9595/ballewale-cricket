In a historic achievement for Uttarakhand cricket, the team has qualified for their first-ever semi-final in the ongoing domestic tournament, thanks to a remarkable double-century by opener Ranjit Gharami. Gharami's innings of 202 runs propelled Uttarakhand to a formidable total, ultimately leading them to a comprehensive victory over Andhra by 150 runs in the quarter-final match held at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad.

Uttarakhand, batting first, posted a daunting score of 420 runs, with Gharami's stellar performance at the forefront. His innings included 24 boundaries and 5 sixes, showcasing a blend of aggression and finesse that left the Andhra bowlers struggling to contain the onslaught. Gharami's partnership with captain Ankit Bhandari, who contributed a solid 85 runs, further solidified Uttarakhand's position, as they dominated the bowling attack throughout the innings. Andhra's bowlers, including their leading wicket-taker, faced a tough day on the field, with only sporadic breakthroughs to show for their efforts.

In response, Andhra's batting lineup faltered against a disciplined Uttarakhand bowling attack. Despite a fighting half-century from their captain, Hanuma Vihari, who scored 67 runs, the team crumbled under pressure, ultimately being bowled out for just 270 runs. Uttarakhand's bowlers, led by pacer Shivam Dube, who took 4 wickets for 56 runs, executed their plans with precision, ensuring that Andhra never gained any momentum in their chase. The victory not only marks a significant milestone for Uttarakhand cricket but also highlights the team's potential to compete at higher levels in the domestic circuit.

Uttarakhand's qualification for the semi-finals is a testament to their hard work and determination throughout the tournament. The team will now look forward to their next challenge, aiming to continue their impressive form and make a mark in the semi-final. With Gharami in top form and the team displaying a collective spirit, Uttarakhand is set to be a formidable opponent in the upcoming matches. As they prepare for this crucial encounter, cricket fans will be eager to see if they can maintain their momentum and possibly secure a place in the finals.
