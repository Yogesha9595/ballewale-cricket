In a candid assessment of Sri Lanka's recent batting struggles, captain Dasun Shanaka has pointed to the spin-friendly conditions prevalent in the country as a significant factor affecting the team's performance. Speaking to reporters after a training session, Shanaka expressed a desire for flatter tracks that would allow batsmen to play more freely and capitalize on their skills.

Sri Lanka has faced criticism for its inconsistent batting displays, particularly in home series where the pitches tend to favor spinners. Shanaka noted that while the team has talented players, the challenging conditions often hinder their ability to build partnerships and score runs effectively. He emphasized that adapting to different pitch conditions is crucial, but a more balanced surface could help the team find its rhythm and improve overall performance.

The Sri Lankan team has a rich history of producing world-class batsmen, but recent performances have raised concerns among fans and analysts alike. Shanaka's comments reflect a growing sentiment within the squad that the current pitch conditions may not be conducive to showcasing their batting prowess. As the team prepares for upcoming international fixtures, including a series against top-ranked teams, the need for a more favorable batting surface has become a topic of discussion among players and coaching staff.

In conclusion, Dasun Shanaka's remarks highlight the ongoing challenges faced by Sri Lankan batsmen in adapting to spin-friendly pitches at home. While the team continues to work on its strategies to overcome these obstacles, the call for flatter tracks may resonate with many who believe that such conditions could enhance the team's performance and restore confidence among the batsmen. As Sri Lanka looks to regain its competitive edge on the international stage, the conversation around pitch preparation will likely remain a focal point for both players and selectors.
