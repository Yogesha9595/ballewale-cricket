In a gripping encounter at the World Cup 2023, the Netherlands came agonizingly close to securing a historic victory over Pakistan, only to fall short by a mere 11 runs. The match, held at the iconic Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium in Hyderabad, showcased the resilience and determination of the Dutch side, but it was ultimately Pakistan's experience that saw them through in a tense finish. After the match, Netherlands' bowler, Paul van Meekeren, expressed his disappointment, stating, "We should have potentially sent Pakistan home after today."

The Netherlands, chasing 192 runs for victory, started their innings with a solid foundation, but a flurry of wickets in the middle overs derailed their progress. Van Meekeren, who contributed significantly with the ball, lamented the missed opportunities that could have changed the course of the match. "We had them under pressure, and we just needed to capitalize on a few more chances. It’s frustrating to come so close and not finish the job," he added, reflecting on the narrow margin of defeat.

Pakistan's bowlers, led by Shaheen Afridi, displayed their prowess, taking crucial wickets at pivotal moments. The pressure mounted on the Dutch batters, who struggled to maintain their composure as they approached the target. Despite the loss, van Meekeren remained optimistic about the team's performance, emphasizing the positives they can take from the match. "We showed that we can compete at this level, and we will learn from this experience moving forward in the tournament," he stated.

As the World Cup progresses, the Netherlands will be looking to bounce back from this narrow defeat. With several matches still to play, van Meekeren and his teammates are determined to build on their performance against Pakistan. The Dutch side will aim to convert their near misses into victories, hoping to make a significant impact in the tournament. The cricketing world will be watching closely as they seek to capitalize on their potential and prove that they belong among the elite in international cricket.
