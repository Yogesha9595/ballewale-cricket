The warm-up match is expected to offer insights into the strengths and weaknesses of both teams, allowing Oman to fine-tune their approach before facing their first official match.

Zimbabwe, a seasoned team with a mix of experienced players and emerging talents, poses a significant challenge for Oman. However, Singh remains confident that the experience gained from the warm-up will empower his team to perform at their best. "It's not just about the skills on the field; it's also about how we mentally prepare ourselves. A good performance in the warm-up can set the tone for the entire tournament," he added. The match will be crucial for both teams as they look to solidify their strategies and assess player form ahead of the high-stakes competition.

As Oman prepares for its World Cup journey, Singh's emphasis on the psychological aspect of the warm-up match underscores the mental fortitude required to succeed at this level. The team aims to harness the lessons learned from the encounter with Zimbabwe to build confidence and resilience. With the World Cup just around the corner, both teams will be looking to make the most of this opportunity to gain an upper hand in the tournament. The warm-up match not only serves as a preparatory exercise but also as a potential morale booster, setting the stage for what promises to be an exciting World Cup campaign for Oman.
