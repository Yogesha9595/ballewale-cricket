In a thrilling contest at the Bellerive Oval, Tasmania managed to maintain a narrow lead over Western Australia, thanks to a resilient performance from their middle-order batsman, Tim Webster. After a shaky start to their second innings, Webster's composed knock proved crucial in keeping Tasmania ahead in this hard-fought domestic fixture. Meanwhile, Cameron Bancroft's determined innings provided a glimmer of hope for Western Australia, setting up an intriguing final day of play.

Tasmania resumed their second innings with a slender first-innings lead of 35 runs. However, early wickets fell quickly, putting the team in a precarious position. The pressure was on as the Western Australian bowlers, led by the experienced Jhye Richardson, sought to capitalize on the early breakthroughs. Webster, however, showed remarkable poise and skill, anchoring the innings with a well-crafted 75 runs. His ability to rotate the strike and find boundaries at crucial moments helped Tasmania recover from 45 for 4 to post a total of 207, setting a challenging target for the visitors.

In response, Western Australia began their chase with renewed vigor, and Bancroft's innings was pivotal in keeping them in the game. The former Australian opener played a gritty knock, scoring 60 runs and stabilizing the innings after a few early setbacks. His partnership with the lower order gave Western Australia a fighting chance, but they still faced the daunting task of chasing down Tasmania's target. With the match hanging in the balance, Bancroft's dismissal left the visitors needing 50 runs with three wickets in hand, raising the stakes for the final session of play.

As the match heads into its concluding stages, Tasmania will be looking to their bowlers to deliver under pressure. The match remains finely poised, with both teams having their moments of dominance. Webster's performance has been a highlight for Tasmania, while Bancroft's efforts have kept Western Australia in contention. With the final day promising to be an exciting showdown, fans can expect a riveting finish as both sides vie for victory in this domestic clash.
