In a remarkable display of bowling prowess, Mohammad Nabi led Jammu & Kashmir to their first-ever semi-final in the Ranji Trophy, claiming 12 wickets in the match against Madhya Pradesh. The historic encounter concluded at the Sher-e-Kashmir Stadium in Srinagar, where J&K emerged victorious by a margin of 135 runs, marking a significant milestone in the team's cricketing journey.

Nabi's exceptional performance was pivotal in dismantling the Madhya Pradesh batting lineup, as he finished with figures of 7 for 41 in the first innings and 5 for 63 in the second. His relentless accuracy and ability to extract movement from the pitch proved too challenging for the opposition. Despite a valiant effort from Madhya Pradesh's lower order, who fought hard to chase down J&K's total, they ultimately fell short, bowled out for 185 runs in their second innings.

Jammu & Kashmir set a target of 320 runs after declaring their second innings at 294 for 6. The home side's batting was bolstered by a solid performance from their middle order, with contributions from the likes of Parvez Rasool and Abdul Samad. The combined effort with the ball from Nabi and the rest of the bowling attack ensured that J&K's dream of reaching the semi-finals became a reality.

This victory not only highlights the potential of Jammu & Kashmir cricket but also showcases the talent of Mohammad Nabi, who has been a key player for the team. As they prepare for the semi-final, J&K will look to build on this momentum, aiming to make further history in the prestigious tournament. The triumph over Madhya Pradesh is a testament to the hard work and determination of the players and coaching staff, and it sets the stage for an exciting semi-final clash ahead.
