# Ranaweera's Four-for Leads Sri Lanka to Tense Win Over West Indies

In a thrilling opening One Day International (ODI) match, Sri Lanka managed to defend a modest total of 240 runs, edging out the West Indies by just ten runs. The match, held at the picturesque R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, was marked by a brilliant bowling performance from Sri Lankan spinner Prabath Ranaweera, whose four wickets proved crucial in securing the victory for his team.

## A Slow-Burning Innings from Sri Lanka

The West Indies bowlers, led by their captain, delivered an impressive performance that kept the Sri Lankan batsmen in check.

In response, the West Indies started their innings with a sense of purpose. Openers Shai Hope and Kyle Mayers looked to build a solid foundation, putting on a 50-run partnership. However, the Sri Lankan bowlers had other ideas. Ranaweera, who was introduced into the attack in the 10th over, quickly made his mark.

His spin troubled the West Indies batsmen, leading to the dismissal of Mayers for 29 runs. The breakthrough sparked a mini-collapse, as Ranaweera's variations and flight caused chaos in the West Indies batting lineup. With wickets falling at regular intervals, the visitors found themselves in a precarious position at 150 for 7.
