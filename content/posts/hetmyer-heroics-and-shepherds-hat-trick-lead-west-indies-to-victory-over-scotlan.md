In a thrilling opening match of the international series, the West Indies showcased their prowess with a commanding victory over Scotland, driven by Shimron Hetmyer's explosive batting and Romario Shepherd's remarkable hat-trick. The match, held at the picturesque venue of Edinburgh, saw the West Indies dominate from the outset, setting the tone for what promises to be an exciting series.

Shimron Hetmyer was the standout performer for the West Indies, scoring a blistering 85 runs off just 53 balls. His innings was laced with six boundaries and four towering sixes, demonstrating his ability to accelerate the scoring at crucial moments. Hetmyer's aggressive approach helped the West Indies post a formidable total of 245 runs for the loss of 7 wickets in their allotted 50 overs. His partnership with Shai Hope, who contributed a steady 62 runs, was pivotal in stabilizing the innings after an early wicket.

On the bowling front, Romario Shepherd stole the limelight with an exceptional performance, claiming a hat-trick that left Scotland reeling. Shepherd's spell of 4 wickets for 32 runs in 8 overs was instrumental in dismantling the Scottish batting lineup. His hat-trick included the crucial wickets of Scotland's top-order batsmen, effectively turning the tide in favor of the West Indies. The Scottish team ultimately succumbed to the pressure, being bowled out for just 112 runs in 30.2 overs, handing the West Indies a comprehensive 133-run victory.

The match not only highlighted the individual brilliance of Hetmyer and Shepherd but also showcased the depth and talent within the West Indies squad. As they look ahead to the upcoming matches in the series, this performance will serve as a significant confidence booster. With the World Cup on the horizon, the West Indies will aim to build on this momentum and continue to improve as they prepare for the challenges ahead. The victory over Scotland marks a promising start to their international campaign, setting high expectations for their future performances.
