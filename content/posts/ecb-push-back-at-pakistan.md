# ECB Push Back at Pakistan 'Shadow-Ban' Reports Ahead of Hundred Auction

As the excitement builds for the upcoming Hundred auction set to take place in March, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has taken a firm stance against recent claims of a 'shadow-ban' on Pakistani players. With over 50 Pakistani cricketers registering for the event, the ECB aims to clarify its position and ensure that the focus remains on the talent pool available for selection.

## Understanding the 'Shadow-Ban' Allegations

In recent weeks, rumors have circulated regarding a supposed 'shadow-ban' affecting Pakistani players in the Hundred. Critics have pointed to a perceived lack of representation from Pakistani cricketers in previous editions of the tournament, suggesting that the ECB has been less than welcoming towards players from the nation. Such claims have raised eyebrows, especially with the significant number of Pakistani players registering for the upcoming auction.

However, the ECB has firmly denied these allegations, emphasizing its commitment to inclusivity and diversity in the tournament. The board's representatives have reiterated that all players, regardless of nationality, are encouraged to participate and showcase their skills on this prestigious platform.

The upcoming Hundred auction has seen an impressive response from players around the globe, with a total of 950 registrations. Among these, more than 50 Pakistani players have thrown their hats into the ring, showcasing the immense talent that the country has to offer. This strong representation is a testament to the growing popularity of the tournament and the desire of Pakistani cricketers to compete at the highest level.

The ECB's proactive approach to promoting international talent is evident in its efforts to ensure that the Hundred remains a melting pot of cricketing cultures. The participation of Pakistani players not only enhances the competition but also enriches the tournament's overall narrative.

## ECB's Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion

In response to the 'shadow-ban' allegations, the ECB has reiterated its commitment to diversity and inclusion within the sport. The board has made significant strides in recent years to promote cricket among various communities, and the Hundred is a reflection of this ethos. By welcoming players from different backgrounds, the ECB aims to create a vibrant and competitive environment that resonates with fans across the globe.

The ECB's initiatives extend beyond just player recruitment. The board has also been working to engage with local communities and inspire the next generation of cricketers. By fostering a culture of inclusivity, the ECB hopes to break down barriers and ensure that cricket remains accessible to all.

## The Importance of the Hundred for Pakistani Players
