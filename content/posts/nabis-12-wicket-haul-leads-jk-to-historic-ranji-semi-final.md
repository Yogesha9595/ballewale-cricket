In a historic achievement for Jammu and Kashmir, Mohammad Nabi's extraordinary bowling performance led the team to their first-ever semi-final in the Ranji Trophy, defeating Madhya Pradesh by a significant margin. Nabi's remarkable 12-wicket haul across both innings was instrumental in securing the victory, showcasing his prowess and experience on the domestic stage.

The match, held at the iconic Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium, saw Jammu and Kashmir dominate from the outset. After winning the toss, the team opted to bowl first, a decision that proved to be pivotal. Nabi, with his left-arm orthodox spin, dismantled the Madhya Pradesh batting lineup, claiming 7 wickets for just 45 runs in the first innings. His exceptional spell left Madhya Pradesh reeling at a mere 118 runs, setting the tone for Jammu and Kashmir's commanding performance.

In response, Jammu and Kashmir posted a competitive total of 275, giving them a substantial lead. However, it was Nabi's second innings that truly etched his name in the record books. He returned to the attack with renewed vigor, claiming 5 wickets for 62 runs, effectively wrapping up the Madhya Pradesh innings for just 162 runs. The final margin of victory for Jammu and Kashmir was 95 runs, marking a significant milestone in the team's cricketing history.

This victory not only highlights the talent emerging from Jammu and Kashmir but also sets a precedent for future generations of cricketers in the region. The semi-final will see Jammu and Kashmir face a formidable opponent, but with the momentum gained from this match and Nabi's exceptional form, they will be looking to continue their fairytale run in the tournament. As the Ranji Trophy progresses, cricket fans will undoubtedly keep a close eye on this inspiring team.
