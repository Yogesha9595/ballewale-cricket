In a recent interview, Zimbabwean all-rounder Sikandar Raza expressed his belief that Associate nations have significantly closed the gap with Full Member teams in the T20 format. Raza's comments come in the wake of impressive performances by Associate nations in various T20 leagues and international tournaments, showcasing their ability to compete at the highest level.

Raza pointed to the increasing number of Associate players making their mark in prominent T20 leagues around the world, including the Indian Premier League (IPL) and other franchise tournaments. He noted that the exposure to high-pressure situations and the opportunity to play alongside and against some of the best players in the world has been instrumental in the development of Associate cricketers. "The quality of cricket being played by Associate nations has improved tremendously, and we are no longer seen as underdogs," Raza stated. "The T20 format has allowed us to showcase our talent on a global stage, and we are ready to compete with the best."

The growth of T20 cricket has provided a platform for Associate nations to gain recognition and respect in the cricketing world. Raza highlighted that tournaments like the T20 World Cup have allowed these teams to demonstrate their capabilities, with several upsets recorded in recent editions. The competitive spirit and skill level displayed by teams such as Afghanistan, Ireland, and Scotland have contributed to a shift in perception regarding Associate nations, which were once considered less competitive.

As the cricketing landscape continues to evolve, Raza emphasized the importance of investment in grassroots cricket and infrastructure within Associate nations. He believes that with the right support and resources, these teams can further enhance their performance and continue to challenge traditional cricketing powerhouses. In conclusion, Raza's insights reflect a growing recognition of the potential within Associate nations, particularly in the T20 format, as they strive to establish themselves as formidable competitors in international cricket.
