In a thrilling encounter at the Gabba, Queensland's bowlers, led by the impressive performances of Jack Straker and Mitchell Swepson, secured a convincing victory over New South Wales, setting the stage for a possible Sheffield Shield final preview. Queensland's triumph by an innings and 45 runs showcased their formidable bowling attack and solidified their position at the top of the Shield standings.

Straker, making a significant impact with the ball, took 5 wickets for 45 runs in New South Wales' first innings, dismantling their batting order with precision and flair. His ability to swing the ball and maintain pressure was pivotal in restricting New South Wales to a modest total. Swepson, the seasoned leg-spinner, complemented Straker's efforts by claiming 4 wickets in the second innings, further emphasizing Queensland's dominance in the match. The duo's combined efforts not only highlighted their individual skills but also underscored the strength of Queensland's bowling unit.

New South Wales, batting first, struggled to find any rhythm against a relentless Queensland attack. Despite a valiant effort from their lower order, the team was unable to post a competitive score, which left them vulnerable. In response, Queensland's batsmen capitalized on the opportunity, with a solid performance that set a daunting target. The match concluded with Queensland's bowlers once again proving too hot to handle for New South Wales, who were unable to mount a significant challenge in their second innings.

This match not only showcased the talent within the Queensland squad but also raised eyebrows about a potential clash in the Sheffield Shield final later this season. As both teams continue to vie for a spot in the final, the performances of Straker and Swepson will undoubtedly be pivotal in the coming weeks. Queensland's victory serves as a reminder of their capabilities and positions them as strong contenders for the title, while New South Wales will need to regroup and address their batting woes ahead of their next fixture.
