As Australia gears up for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023, fast bowler Nathan Ellis has expressed confidence in the team's pace depth, underscoring that the absence of big-name players will not hinder their performance. With the likes of Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood sidelined due to injury, the onus is now on a fresh crop of bowlers to step up and deliver for the defending champions.

Ellis, who has been a standout performer in domestic cricket, believes that the depth in Australia’s pace bowling unit is a significant advantage. He pointed out that the team has a rich history of producing world-class fast bowlers, and this time is no different. Young talents such as Sean Abbott and Marcus Stoinis have already made their mark in the international arena, and Ellis is optimistic that they will rise to the occasion in the high-pressure environment of the World Cup.

In the lead-up to the tournament, Ellis emphasized the importance of adaptability and resilience among the bowlers. He noted that while Cummins and Hazlewood bring experience and skill, the new faces in the squad are eager to prove themselves on the world stage. The Australian selectors have shown faith in these players, and Ellis is confident that they will deliver performances that meet the expectations of fans and selectors alike.

As the World Cup approaches, Australia will look to finalize their squad, but Ellis's comments highlight a broader theme within the team: the belief in their collective strength. With a strong pace attack that can exploit various conditions, Australia aims to defend their title and make a significant impact in the tournament. The upcoming matches will be a true test of the depth and quality of Australia's bowling lineup, and Ellis's faith in his teammates could be a crucial factor in their quest for World Cup glory.
