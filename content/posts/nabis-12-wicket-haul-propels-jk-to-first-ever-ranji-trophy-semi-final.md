In a historic achievement for Jammu & Kashmir cricket, Mohammad Nabi's extraordinary performance with the ball led the team to their first-ever semi-final in the Ranji Trophy. The all-rounder claimed a remarkable 12 wickets across both innings, dismantling Madhya Pradesh's batting line-up and ensuring a comprehensive victory for J&K by an innings and 33 runs. This victory not only marks a significant milestone for the team but also highlights Nabi's pivotal role in their journey through the tournament.

After electing to bat first, Madhya Pradesh struggled to find their footing against a relentless J&K bowling attack, spearheaded by Nabi. The visitors were bowled out for a mere 134 runs in their first innings, with Nabi claiming 7 wickets for just 32 runs. J&K's bowlers maintained relentless pressure, and despite a brief resistance from the middle order, Madhya Pradesh could not recover. In their second innings, the story was no different, as Nabi returned to claim 5 wickets, restricting Madhya Pradesh to 167 runs.

Jammu & Kashmir's victory is a testament to their resilience and determination throughout the tournament. The team has shown remarkable improvement over the past few seasons, and this semi-final berth is a reflection of their hard work and commitment. The coaching staff and players alike have emphasized the importance of teamwork and discipline, which has been clearly evident in their performances.

As J&K prepares for their semi-final clash, the cricketing fraternity is abuzz with excitement. This achievement not only puts Jammu & Kashmir on the domestic cricket map but also inspires a new generation of cricketers in the region. With Mohammad Nabi leading the charge, the team will look to build on this momentum and aim for a place in the Ranji Trophy final.
