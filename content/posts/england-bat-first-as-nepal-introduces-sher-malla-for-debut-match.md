In an eagerly anticipated international fixture, England won the toss and elected to bat first against Nepal, who have made headlines by handing a debut to promising young cricketer Sher Malla. The match, taking place at the picturesque Tribhuvan University International Cricket Ground in Kirtipur, marks a significant moment for Nepalese cricket as they continue to develop their talent on the global stage.

England's decision to bat first reflects their strategy to set a challenging total, leveraging their experienced batting lineup. With a mix of seasoned players and emerging talent, the English squad aims to build momentum early in the innings. The team has been in fine form recently, showcasing their batting depth and aggressive style of play. Captain Jos Buttler expressed confidence in the batting order, emphasizing the importance of a strong start to put pressure on the Nepalese bowlers.

On the other hand, Sher Malla's inclusion in the squad is a testament to Nepal's commitment to nurturing young talent.
