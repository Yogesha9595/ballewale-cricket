  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>In a candid assessment of Sri Lanka’s recent batting struggles, captain Dasun Shanaka has pointed to the spin-friendly conditions prevalent in the country as a significant factor affecting the team’s performance.

    <p>In a gripping encounter at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Victoria’s middle-order batsman, Jake Brasher, showcased remarkable resilience with a defiant half-century, steering his team to a competitive position after a challenging start against Tasmania.
