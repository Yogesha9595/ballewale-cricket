  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>In a significant development ahead of their latest World Cup fixture, India has announced that pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah will miss the match against the USA due to illness. In his absence, the Indian selectors have opted to include Mohammed Siraj in the playing XI, a decision that underscores the team’s depth in bowling options as they look to maintain their strong performance in the tournament.
Bumrah, who has been a pivotal figure in India’s bowling attack, was reported unwell just hours before the match, prompting the team management to make a swift change. Siraj, who has been in impressive form, particularly in the ODI format, will be looking to seize this opportunity to showcase his skills on the world stage. The 29-year-old has been a consistent performer for India, and his ability to swing the ball both ways could prove crucial against a USA side that is relatively new to the World Cup environment.
