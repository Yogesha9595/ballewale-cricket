    <p>In a significant T20 clash at the picturesque venue of the Cricket Club of Italy in Milan, Italy has won the toss and opted to bowl first against Scotland. This match is part of a series aimed at enhancing both teams&rsquo; preparations for upcoming international fixtures. The decision to field first reflects Italy&rsquo;s confidence in their bowling attack, which has shown promising form in recent matches.</p>
<p>Scotland, on the other hand, has made a notable inclusion in their squad by playing Brad Wheal, the talented fast bowler who has been making waves in domestic cricket. Wheal&rsquo;s selection is seen as a strategic move to bolster Scotland&rsquo;s pace options, especially on a pitch that is expected to offer assistance to seamers early on. The Scottish side will be looking to set a competitive total, relying on their experienced batsmen to capitalize on any early scoring opportunities.</p>
<p>Italy&rsquo;s bowling unit, led by their captain, will aim to exploit the conditions and restrict Scotland&rsquo;s scoring. The Italian side has been steadily improving in the T20 format and will be eager to showcase their skills on home soil. With a mix of experienced players and young talent, Italy is poised to make a strong statement in this match.</p>
<p>As the teams take to the field, fans can expect an exciting contest filled with competitive spirit. Both sides are keen to make their mark, and this match serves as an important step in their journey towards greater achievements in international cricket. With the toss outcome favoring Italy, the stage is set for a thrilling encounter.</p>
