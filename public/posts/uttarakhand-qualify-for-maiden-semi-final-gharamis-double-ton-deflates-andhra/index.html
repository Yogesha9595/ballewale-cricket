    <p>In a historic achievement for Uttarakhand cricket, the team has qualified for their first-ever semi-final in the ongoing domestic tournament, thanks to a remarkable double-century by opener Ranjit Gharami. Gharami&rsquo;s innings of 202 runs propelled Uttarakhand to a formidable total, ultimately leading them to a comprehensive victory over Andhra by 150 runs in the quarter-final match held at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad.</p>
<p>Uttarakhand, batting first, posted a daunting score of 420 runs, with Gharami&rsquo;s stellar performance at the forefront. His innings included 24 boundaries and 5 sixes, showcasing a blend of aggression and finesse that left the Andhra bowlers struggling to contain the onslaught. Gharami&rsquo;s partnership with captain Ankit Bhandari, who contributed a solid 85 runs, further solidified Uttarakhand&rsquo;s position, as they dominated the bowling attack throughout the innings. Andhra&rsquo;s bowlers, including their leading wicket-taker, faced a tough day on the field, with only sporadic breakthroughs to show for their efforts.</p>
<p>In response, Andhra&rsquo;s batting lineup faltered against a disciplined Uttarakhand bowling attack. Despite a fighting half-century from their captain, Hanuma Vihari, who scored 67 runs, the team crumbled under pressure, ultimately being bowled out for just 270 runs. Uttarakhand&rsquo;s bowlers, led by pacer Shivam Dube, who took 4 wickets for 56 runs, executed their plans with precision, ensuring that Andhra never gained any momentum in their chase. The victory not only marks a significant milestone for Uttarakhand cricket but also highlights the team&rsquo;s potential to compete at higher levels in the domestic circuit.</p>
<p>Uttarakhand&rsquo;s qualification for the semi-finals is a testament to their hard work and determination throughout the tournament. The team will now look forward to their next challenge, aiming to continue their impressive form and make a mark in the semi-final. With Gharami in top form and the team displaying a collective spirit, Uttarakhand is set to be a formidable opponent in the upcoming matches. As they prepare for this crucial encounter, cricket fans will be eager to see if they can maintain their momentum and possibly secure a place in the finals.</p>
