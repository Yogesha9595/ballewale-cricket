    <p>In a notable decision during their World Cup encounter, Ireland has opted to include an extra batter in their playing XI, asking Sri Lanka to bat first after winning the toss. This strategic move reflects Ireland&rsquo;s intent to bolster their batting lineup, aiming to capitalize on any early bowling conditions and set a challenging target for their opponents.</p>
<p>Ireland&rsquo;s captain, in making this decision, has emphasized the importance of depth in their batting order, especially against a competitive Sri Lankan side known for its bowling prowess. By opting for an additional batsman, Ireland is looking to ensure that they have sufficient firepower to post a substantial score, should they face early setbacks in their innings. The inclusion of an extra batter also suggests a focus on building partnerships and maintaining a steady run rate throughout the innings.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka, on the other hand, will be keen to exploit the early conditions with their experienced bowling attack. The team has been in good form, and their bowlers will look to make early inroads into the Irish batting lineup. With the pitch expected to offer some assistance to seamers in the initial overs, the Sri Lankan bowlers will be eager to capitalize on this advantage and put pressure on the Irish batsmen.</p>
<p>As the match progresses, all eyes will be on how Ireland&rsquo;s decision to strengthen their batting lineup pays off. The outcome of this tactical choice could be pivotal in determining the direction of the game, especially in a high-stakes World Cup setting. Both teams have a lot at stake, and the battle between bat and ball promises to be an exciting spectacle for cricket fans around the world.</p>
