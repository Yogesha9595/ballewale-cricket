    <p>In a compelling One Day International (ODI) match on Wednesday, Zimbabwe showcased their cricketing prowess with a commanding victory over Oman, led by the exceptional performances of Blessing Muzarabani and Richard Ngarava. The match, held at the Harare Sports Club, saw Zimbabwe chase down a target of 250 runs with relative ease, securing their win by a margin of 75 runs.

The standout performance came from the explosive Ryan Burl, who scored a blistering 85 runs off just 70 balls, propelling Zimbabwe to a total of 249 runs before being bowled out in the 49th over. Oman’s bowlers, while disciplined, struggled to contain the Zimbabwean batsmen, with Bilal Khan claiming three wickets but conceding 54 runs in the process.
