    <p>In a highly anticipated T20 match, Italy has won the toss and opted to bowl first against Scotland at the picturesque venue in Edinburgh. This decision comes as both teams look to make a significant impact in the ongoing series, with Italy aiming to build on their recent performances and Scotland eager to assert their dominance on home soil.</p>
<p>Scotland, led by their captain, has made a notable change to their lineup with the inclusion of fast bowler Brad Wheal, who is set to make his debut. Wheal&rsquo;s addition is expected to bolster Scotland&rsquo;s bowling attack, providing them with an extra edge in pace and skill. The team will be looking to capitalize on the home advantage and set a challenging target for the Italians.</p>
<p>Italy, on the other hand, has shown resilience in their recent outings, and their decision to bowl first indicates a strategic approach to the game. The team will be keen to exploit any early movement in the air and on the pitch, especially considering the overcast conditions that could assist seam bowlers. Italy&rsquo;s captain expressed confidence in their bowling unit, which has been performing well, and they will aim to restrict Scotland to a low total.</p>
<p>As the match progresses, both teams will be looking to showcase their talents in this exciting format of the game. With Italy opting to bowl first, the onus will be on their bowlers to deliver an impressive performance and set the stage for a competitive chase. Fans are eagerly awaiting the action as Scotland takes to the field with their debutant, Wheal, ready to make his mark.</p>
