    <p>In a gripping encounter at the Eden Gardens, Bengal&rsquo;s young opener, Sudip Gharami, played a pivotal role in securing a draw against Andhra in their Ranji Trophy clash. Gharami&rsquo;s unbeaten century, which stood at 115 runs, was instrumental in keeping Bengal&rsquo;s hopes alive in the tournament. The match, which concluded on the fourth day, saw Bengal battling hard after being set a challenging target by Andhra, who declared their second innings at 305 runs.</p>
<p>Bengal began their chase with a shaky start, losing early wickets and finding themselves in a precarious position at 56 for 3. However, Gharami’s resilience and determination shone through as he anchored the innings, forming crucial partnerships with the middle order. His innings was marked by a blend of caution and aggression, as he struck 12 boundaries and a six, showcasing his ability to rotate the strike and keep the scoreboard ticking. Gharami’s performance was not just a display of individual brilliance but also a testament to his maturity as a young cricketer in high-pressure situations.</p>
<p>As the match progressed, Bengal&rsquo;s lower order contributed valuable runs, allowing Gharami to play his natural game. The team managed to finish their innings at 245 for 8, ensuring they avoided defeat. With the draw, Bengal earned crucial points in the tournament, keeping their hopes of advancing alive. Andhra, on the other hand, will be pleased with their overall performance, particularly from their bowlers who put Bengal under pressure throughout the match.</p>
<p>As the Ranji Trophy continues, Gharami&rsquo;s innings serves as a reminder of the talent emerging from Bengal cricket. His ability to perform under pressure could prove vital for the team in the upcoming matches. With several games left in the season, both teams will be looking to build on their performances as they aim for a strong finish in the tournament.</p>
