    <p>In a gripping encounter at the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023, England narrowly defeated Nepal in a thrilling last-over finish, showcasing both teams&rsquo; determination and skill. The match, held at the iconic Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, saw England chase down a challenging target of 250 runs set by the spirited Nepalese side. With the victory, England not only secured crucial points in their World Cup campaign but also highlighted the growing competitiveness of associate nations in the global cricketing landscape.</p>
<p>Nepal, playing in their first World Cup, put on a commendable performance with the bat, thanks to a solid opening partnership that laid the foundation for their innings. Captain Sandeep Lamichhane led from the front, scoring a vital 75 runs, while the middle order contributed significantly to help Nepal post a competitive total of 249 runs. England&rsquo;s bowlers faced a stern test, with Mark Wood and Adil Rashid being the pick of the bowlers, claiming key wickets at crucial moments to keep the run chase within reach.</p>
<p>In response, England’s innings got off to a shaky start, losing early wickets that put them under pressure. However, a resilient partnership between Joe Root and Ben Stokes steadied the ship. Root&rsquo;s composed knock of 85 runs was instrumental in guiding England towards their target. As the match progressed, the tension mounted, with England needing 15 runs off the final over. A combination of calmness under pressure and some aggressive hitting saw them cross the line with just two balls to spare, sealing a memorable victory.</p>
<p>This match serves as a reminder of the unpredictability of cricket, where even established teams can face challenges from emerging nations. England&rsquo;s ability to adapt and perform under pressure will be crucial as they continue their World Cup journey. Meanwhile, Nepal&rsquo;s spirited display has earned them respect and admiration, proving that they are a force to be reckoned with on the international stage. As the tournament progresses, both teams will look to build on their performances, with England aiming for a strong finish and Nepal seeking to capitalize on their newfound confidence.</p>
