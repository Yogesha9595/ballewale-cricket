    <p>In a gripping encounter at the Sydney Cricket Ground, Queensland&rsquo;s bowlers, led by the impressive performances of Jack Straker and Mitch Swepson, secured a convincing victory over New South Wales, setting the stage for a potential Sheffield Shield final preview. Queensland&rsquo;s triumph by 96 runs showcased their depth and resilience, as they continue to assert their dominance in the competition.</p>
<p>Straker&rsquo;s standout performance with the ball was pivotal, as he claimed a remarkable 5 for 32 in the second innings, dismantling New South Wales&rsquo; batting lineup. His ability to swing the ball both ways and maintain tight lines proved too much for the home side, who struggled to build partnerships. Swepson complemented Straker&rsquo;s efforts with his leg-spin, taking crucial wickets at key moments, finishing with figures of 3 for 45. The duo&rsquo;s combined efforts restricted New South Wales to just 150 runs in their second innings, a stark contrast to their first innings total of 296.</p>
<p>Queensland&rsquo;s batting was equally commendable, with a solid opening partnership setting a strong foundation. The visitors posted a competitive total of 246 in their first innings, with contributions from the middle order proving vital. The team&rsquo;s ability to recover from early setbacks highlighted their depth and determination. Captain Usman Khawaja&rsquo;s leadership and experience were evident as he guided his team through challenging phases, ensuring they remained in control throughout the match.</p>
<p>As the Sheffield Shield season progresses, this match serves as a reminder of the competitive nature of domestic cricket in Australia. Both Queensland and New South Wales are strong contenders for the title, and their performances in this match could be indicative of what is to come in the final stages of the tournament. With players like Straker and Swepson stepping up when it matters most, Queensland will be looking to maintain their momentum as they push for a spot in the final.</p>
