  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>In a candid assessment of Sri Lanka’s recent batting struggles, captain Dasun Shanaka has pointed to the spin-friendly conditions prevalent in the country as a significant factor affecting the team’s performance.

Sri Lanka has faced criticism for its inconsistent batting displays, particularly in home series where the pitches tend to favor spinners. Shanaka noted that while the team has talented players, the challenging conditions often hinder their ability to build partnerships and score runs effectively. He emphasized that adapting to different pitch conditions is crucial, but a more balanced surface could help the team find its rhythm and improve overall performance.
