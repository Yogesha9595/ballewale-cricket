    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>In a gripping encounter at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Victoria’s middle-order batsman, Jake Brasher, showcased remarkable resilience with a defiant half-century, steering his team to a competitive position after a challenging start against Tasmania.
