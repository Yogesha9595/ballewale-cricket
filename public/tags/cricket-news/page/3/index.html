    <p>As Australia gears up for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023, fast bowler Nathan Ellis has expressed confidence in the team’s pace depth, underscoring that the absence of big-name players will not hinder their performance.

He pointed out that the team has a rich history of producing world-class fast bowlers, and this time is no different. Young talents such as Sean Abbott and Marcus Stoinis have already made their mark in the international arena, and Ellis is optimistic that they will rise to the occasion in the high-pressure environment of the World Cup.
