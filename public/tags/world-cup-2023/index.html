  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>As Australia gears up for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023, fast bowler Nathan Ellis has expressed confidence in the team’s pace depth, underscoring that the absence of big-name players will not hinder their performance. With the likes of Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood sidelined due to injury, the onus is now on a fresh crop of bowlers to step up and deliver for the defending champions.
Ellis, who has been a standout performer in domestic cricket, believes that the depth in Australia’s pace bowling unit is a significant advantage. He pointed out that the team has a rich history of producing world-class fast bowlers, and this time is no different. Young talents such as Sean Abbott and Marcus Stoinis have already made their mark in the international arena, and Ellis is optimistic that they will rise to the occasion in the high-pressure environment of the World Cup.
